# Tunisian License Plates Recognition
An automatic License Plate Recognition System robust and efficient is becoming more and more a necessity in several areas such as safety, road traffic, prosecution of criminals and parking management (in hotels, companies, airports, universities, etc...)
###### This project is composed of 3 main steps :
- License Plate Detection
- License Plate Segmentation
- Digits Recognition

Each one of these steps is implemented independently of the others in the files above. So, feel free to run each file separately or to join all the files and build the whole project.
